# Product Context

## Why it exists

Many Catholics want to deepen understanding of doctrine and moral theology but find primary texts (like the Summa) dense. LuceLingo lowers the barrier by: (1) rephrasing articles into crisp questions and (2) providing short answers and refutations to common objections.

## Who it serves

- Learners seeking structured review of core topics.
- Catechists and teachers who want bite‑sized prompts.

## How it works (experience)

- Select a question set (by Part/Question range) or random.
- See a question and 3–5 options. Choose an answer to get immediate feedback and a brief refutation of incorrect options.
- Continue through a session; optionally review explanations.

## Content principles

- Faithful to Aquinas’s arguments while succinct and approachable.
- Avoid “authority phrasing” like “According to Aquinas” so questions stand on their own.
- Prefer clarity over completeness; link back to article identifiers for deeper study.

## Example

- Source article: “Whether the existence of God is self‑evident?”
- Generated question: “Is the existence of God self‑evident?” with options including objections and the correct thesis. Refutations summarize replies.
